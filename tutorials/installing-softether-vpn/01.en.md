## Introduction

SoftEther VPN is an open-source VPN server application. It can be used to create VPN servers.
In this tutorial, I'll show you how to set one up for yourself.

**Prerequisites**

* a Hetzner Cloud server (obviously!)
* any Linux distro (I used Debian 10.)

## Step 1 - Server-Side Ops

We'll start by updating and upgrading our packages:
```bash
$ apt update && apt upgrade
```

After that, get the necessary packages and files:
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable/releases/download/v4.38-9760-rtm/softether-vpnserver-v4.38-9760-rtm-2021.08.17-linux-x64-64bit.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf softether-vpnserver-v4.38-9760-rtm-2021.08.17-linux-x64-64bit.tar.gz
$ cd vpnserver
$ apt install build-essential -y
```

Then make the file and move it to the `/usr/local` directory:
```bash
$ make
$ cd ..
$ mv vpnserver /usr/local
$ cd /usr/local/vpnserver
```

Give the files the required permissions and create a new file called `vpn.service` in `systemd`:
```bash
$ chmod 600 *
$ chmod 700 vpnserver
$ chmod 700 vpncmd
$ nano /etc/systemd/system/vpn.service
```

Copy these lines exactly into the file:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=SoftEther VPN Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/local/vpnserver/vpnserver start
ExecStop=/usr/local/vpnserver/vpnserver stop

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and exit. Then enable and start the service:
```bash
$ systemctl enable vpn.service
$ systemctl start vpn.service
```

## Step 2 - Client-Side Ops

In this step, we'll configure our VPN server by connecting to it via the SoftEther VPN Server Manager.

### Step 2.1 - Installing the app

Go to https://www.softether-download.com/en.aspx?product=softether

Select "SoftEther VPN Server Manager for Windows" (if you're using MacOS, you should select MacOS.)

Select "Windows"

Under "Download Files", click the first link (It's the most recent one.)

Install the application.


### Step 2.2 - Connecting to the server

Open the application and select "New Setting"

Enter a name into the "Setting Name" box.
Enter your server's IP address to the "Hostname" box.
Select the "5555 (SE-VPN Port)" under the "Port Number" setting.
Press "OK"
Select the server and press "Connect"
Set an administrator password for your VPN server.

## Step 2.3 - Setting up the VPN server

Tick the "Remote Access VPN Server" box on the pop-up window.
Hit "Next"
Press "Yes" and enter a hub name. (You can leave it as is.)

We'll set our DDNS up later. Hit "Exit"

If you want to set up a L2TP VPN server as well, you can do it here.

You can do your VPN Azure settings here.

Hit "Create Users" and write a username to the "User Name" box.
Write a password to the "Password" box and write your password again in the "Confirm Password" box.

Under "Step 3. Set Local Bridge", choose `ens10` and hit "Close"

Click to the Dynamic DNS 

## Step 3 - Using the VPN

Yet more instructions.

## Conclusion

Congratulations. You've just set up your own VPN. You can connect to it anytime, anywhere.
